## 🧠 Markov Muse: A Generative Poetry Engine

**Markov Muse** is a generative poetry app that explores the intersection of probabilistic modeling, natural language processing, and creative language generation. Built using Markov Chains and optionally compared with neural language models, this project investigates how algorithmic structure can simulate poetic language.

## ✨ Project Goals

- Generate original poetry using first- and higher-order Markov Chains.
- Compare entropy and coherence between probabilistic models and neural models (e.g. GPT-2).
- Visualize token transitions, entropy metrics, and model performance.
- Build an interactive demo that allows users to explore generated poems in real time.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧾 **Tokenization and Corpus Processing**: Clean and tokenize large poetic corpora.
- 🔁 **Markov Chain Implementation**: Supports multiple n-gram depths.
- 📊 **Entropy Analysis**: Quantifies output randomness using information theory.
